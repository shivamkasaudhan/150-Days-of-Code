// Book Allocation Problem
// You are given an array ‘pages’ of integer numbers. In this array, the ‘pages[i]’ represents the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book. There are ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students. 
// Allocate books in a way such that
// Each student gets at least one book.
// Each book should be allocated to a student.
// Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
// You have to allocate the books to ‘m’ students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum.
// Try to solve this problem on your own before moving on to further discussion here.
// Let’s understand the problem statement through an example.
// Number of books = 4 and Number of students = 2
// pages[] = { 10,20,30,40}
// Output
//  60
