// Dear Instructor [Instructor Name],
// I am sorry that I am unable to turn in my homework at this time. First, 
// I ate a rotten [Food], which made me turn [Color] and extremely ill. I 
// came down with a fever of [Number 100-120]. Next, my [Adjective] pet

// because he ate it. I am currently rewriting my homework and hope you 
// will accept it late.
// Sincerely,
// [Your Name]
