// A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener 
// commonly used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A 
// friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop. 
// Your friend wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink 
// without dying as a result. Write a program to supply the answer. The input 
// to the program is the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a mouse 
// (use 5 grams), the mass of the mouse (use 35 grams), and the weight of 
// the dieter (use 45400 grams for a 100 pound person). Assume that the 
// lethal dose for a mouse is proportional to the lethal dose for the human. 
// A single can of soda pop has a mass of 350 grams. To ensure the safety of 
// your friend, be sure the program requests the weight at which the dieter 
// will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current weight. Assume that diet 
// soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use a variable declaration 
// with the modifier const to give a name to this fraction. You may want to 
// express the percent as the double value 0.001. Your program should allow 
// the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes.
