//  Sound travels through air as a result of collisions between the molecules in 
// the air. The temperature of the air affects the speed of the molecules, which 
// in turn affects the speed of sound. The velocity of sound in dry air can be 
// approximated by the formula:
// velocity ≈ 331.3 + 0.61 × Tc
// where Tc
//  is the temperature of the air in degrees Celsius and the velocity is 
// in meters/second.
// Write a program that allows the user to input a starting and an ending 
// temperature. Within this temperature range, the program should output 
// the temperature and the corresponding velocity in 1° increments. For 
// example, if the user entered 0 as the start temperature and 2 as the end 
// temperature, then the program should output
// At 0 degrees Celsius the velocity of sound is 331.3 m/s
// At 1 degrees Celsius the velocity of sound is 331.9 m/s
// At 2 degrees Celsius the velocity of sound is 332.5 m/s
